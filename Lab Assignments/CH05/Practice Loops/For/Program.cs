//while() loop - the 3 parts happen anywhere in the program - 0 or many times? - Indefinite loop
//Dowhile() loop - 1 or many times
//For() loop - Is COUNT controlled - 0 or many times? 

//Declare as iterator variable - PART 1

//Test for iterator variable for boolean condition - PART 2

//If the test is TRUE, the loop will iterate
//If the test is FALSE, the loop will not iterate

//MODIFY the iterator variable - PART 3

    //Step 1 - declare and init the interator variable
    //Step 2 - Test the iterator variable

    //The For loop is a Pre test loop (like the while loop)
